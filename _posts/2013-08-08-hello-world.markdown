Despite what the title suggests, this isn't my first blog post here. But it's
my first post since moving from Wordpress to Jekyll. Wordpress used to be a
great platform for blogging, but it no longer feels right to me. I needed
something simpler, and Jekyll fits the bill perfectly.

It took me 15 minutes to set the Jekyll site up locally, including the time to
write the CSS from scratch. (Admittedly, there isn't much CSS here, but still.)
Now all I need to do is get the generated sites on to the server and configure
nginx to serve a static site.

I haven't gotten round to migrating the posts, but I can't seem to think of
anything from the old site that's worth keeping, so I may not migrate the
content after all.
